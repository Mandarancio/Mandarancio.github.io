After a bachelor in Computer Engineering at the University of Parma (Italy) I worked few years at CERN as developer (first java distributed software than real-time c++ control software) and now I'm studing Computer Science at the University of Geneva (Switzerland).

I am also passionate of photography and travel (and music, movies, comics etc etc).
